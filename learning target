🔥 1. Spring Boot Internals

    Go beyond using Spring — understand how it works under the hood.

    How Dependency Injection works in Spring (Bean Lifecycle, Scope, Proxying, CGLIB)

    Spring Context Refresh Mechanism

    Conditional Beans and AutoConfiguration magic

    Deep dive into @Configuration, @Import, @ComponentScan mechanisms

👉 Read:

    Spring Framework source code (especially AbstractApplicationContext, BeanFactory, AnnotationConfigApplicationContext)

    Spring Boot Autoconfiguration classes (start with spring-boot-autoconfigure module)

🚀 2. JVM Performance & Tuning

    This separates senior devs from architects.

    Garbage Collectors (G1 vs ZGC vs Shenandoah)

    JVM Tuning Flags (-XX:+UseG1GC, -Xms, -Xmx, etc.)

    JIT Compiler, Escape Analysis, Inline Caching

    Profiling Tools: JFR (Java Flight Recorder), VisualVM, YourKit

👉 Read:

    "Java Performance: The Definitive Guide" by Scott Oaks

🧠 3. Advanced Concurrency & Reactive Programming

    You probably already use CompletableFuture and some reactive libraries — go deeper.

    Java’s ForkJoinPool, virtual threads (Project Loom)

    Reactor vs RxJava deep comparison

    Custom schedulers, backpressure handling

    Reactive patterns (fan-out/fan-in, circuit breaking, fallback, retries)

👉 Try:

    Build your own simple reactive system using Project Reactor without Spring WebFlux

    Compare it against imperative Spring Boot performance

🕸️ 4. Microservice Patterns & Distributed Systems

    You’re already using RabbitMQ, Circuit Breakers, and Saga. Go next-level.

    Advanced Saga Management (State Machine-based orchestrators, Durable vs Non-durable)

    Distributed Tracing (Zipkin, OpenTelemetry)

    Idempotency Patterns

    Bulkheads, Rate Limiting, Chaos Engineering

👉 Read:

    "Designing Data-Intensive Applications" by Martin Kleppmann

    "Microservices Patterns" by Chris Richardson

🔒 5. Security Beyond Basics

    You know JWT and OAuth — now explore deep security.

    Spring Security ACL

    Method-level security with custom voters and metadata sources

    Multi-tenant security models

    OWASP top 10 mitigation in Spring (XSS, CSRF, etc.)

👉 Build:

    A secure multi-tenant SaaS prototype

🧰 6. Event Sourcing & CQRS at Scale

    You're using Axon — go further.

    Understand Eventual Consistency trade-offs

    Event Schema Evolution strategies

    Replay strategies and performance

    Event Store compaction and snapshots

🧪 7. Test Strategy for Complex Systems

    You prefer integration tests — time to go pro.

    Testcontainers for true infra-level integration testing

    Contract testing with Spring Cloud Contract

    Consumer-Driven Contracts (CDC) in microservice ecosystems

    Mutation Testing with PIT (Pitest)

✅ Suggested Project:

Build a High-Concurrency Trading Platform
Includes:

    Reactive WebFlux API

    CQRS + Event Sourcing

    RabbitMQ + Dead Letter Queues

    Circuit Breaker & Rate Limiter

    Distributed cache (Redis)

    Monitoring with Prometheus + Grafana

    Testcontainers & Contract Testing

This kind of system will force you to apply performance tuning, advanced design patterns, and real-world trade-offs.
